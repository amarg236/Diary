# [Write Diary - Write and document your day](http://sonamgurung.me/diary/)

[Write Diary](http://sonamgurung.me/diary/) is a simple diary app which I developed during  24 hours challenge. With this app, one can securly store ones day to day account securely and easily. Many features are yet to be added but for now it is just a prototype. I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for front end and PHP for the backend. I used [Landing Page](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/landing-page/) bootstrap templet and modified as per the need.
